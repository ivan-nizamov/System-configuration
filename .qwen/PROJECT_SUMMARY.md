# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Optimize and improve the Hyprland Wayland compositor configuration on a NixOS system for better performance, integration, and user experience.

## Key Knowledge
- The system uses NixOS with a flake-based configuration structure
- Hyprland is configured as the Wayland compositor with dedicated configuration files for desktop and laptop hosts
- The configuration follows a modular structure with common system settings and host-specific overrides
- Key technologies: NixOS, Hyprland, Wayland, xdg-desktop-portal, Qt applications
- Environment uses Gruvbox themes with custom styling for applications

## Recent Actions
- Reviewed existing Hyprland configuration in NixOS across multiple files
- Verified that `programs.hyprland.enable = true;` was correctly set
- Confirmed most Wayland environment variables were in place but identified missing QT variables
- Found that xdg-desktop-portal-wlr and xdg-desktop-portal-gtk were installed but xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland was missing
- Checked scaling configurations and found appropriate integer scaling settings
- Verified LibreOffice was not installed in the system

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Add missing QT environment variables (`QT_QPA_PLATFORM = "wayland"` and `SAL_USE_VCLPLUGIN = "qt6"`) to `wayland-desktop.nix`
2. [DONE] Add `xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland` to system packages in `common-system.nix`
3. [DONE] Update xdg.portal configuration to include hyprland portal as a backend for better integration
4. [TODO] Consider adding LibreOffice installation if needed (either qt5 or qt6 version depending on stability requirements)
5. [TODO] Test the updated configuration by rebuilding the system with `sudo nixos-rebuild switch`
